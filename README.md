## Snake Game with Q-Learning
## This project implements a simple Snake game using Pygame, enhanced with a Q-learning algorithm to train an AI agent to play the game. The agent learns to navigate the snake to eat food while avoiding collisions with walls and itself.

Classic Snake gameplay
AI agent using Q-learning to learn and improve its performance
Adjustable game parameters (speed, block size, etc.)
Real-time rendering using Pygame
## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following:

Python 3.x
Pygame library
NumPy library
You can install the required libraries using pip:

''' bash
Insert Code
## pip install pygame numpy
Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-q-learning.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd snake-q-learning

Install the required libraries as mentioned above.

Usage
To run the game, execute the following command in your terminal:

''' bash
python snake_game.py
The game will start, and the AI agent will begin training over multiple episodes. You can observe the agent's performance as it learns to play the game.

Game Mechanics
The snake starts with a length of 3 blocks and moves in a specified direction.
The goal is to eat the food (red block) to grow the snake and increase the score.
The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.
The agent uses Q-learning to update its knowledge based on the rewards received for its actions.
